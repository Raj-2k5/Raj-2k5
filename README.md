# 💫 About Me:
Hi, I'm Raj Gandhi 👋  
B.Tech Computer Science student with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Data Systems.

I enjoy working at the intersection of algorithms, databases, and backend development. 
My focus is on building structured, scalable systems grounded in strong fundamentals.

Currently preparing deeply in core CS subjects and exploring 
how intelligent systems are engineered from theory to deployment.
